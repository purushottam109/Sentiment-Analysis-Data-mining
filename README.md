# Sentiment-Analysis-Data-mining-

Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining)
refers to the use of natural language processing, text
analysis and computational linguistics to identify and
extract subjective information in source materials
Generally, sentiment analysis aims to determine the
attitude of a speaker or a writer with respect to some topic
or the overall contextual polarity of a document. The
attitude may be his or her judgment or evaluation,
affective state (the emotional state of the author when
writing), or the intended emotional communication (the
emotional effect the author wishes to have on the
reader)

This project addresses the problem of deriving the
correct opinion or sentiment of the reviewer from what has
been written in the review. The discussion includes the
comparison of two strategies to mine the sentiment from
the text. 

First approach uses Weka ,a popular data mining
tool. Seccond approach uses the SentiwordNet, a tool
created at Princeton University. Weka learns a model for
the task while Sentiwordnet works by assigning each word
certain score. The evaluation metrics are determined and
the projects concludes with comparison of the approaches.
